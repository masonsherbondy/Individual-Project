# Classification
This repo is for the display of my IBM employee attrition project (classification project). 

# About the Project

## Project Goals
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model to use on fictional IBM data to predict employee attrition, that is, whether or not an employee from this fictional data set will leave the company.

## Project Description
IBM has created a fictional data set based on an employee survey. Employee attrition brings about costs such as business disruption, hiring and training new staff. Exploring this data and testing my models here will give me better insights on how to run through a data set in order to classify records and on what IBM is looking at when considering the flight risk of an employee.

## Project Summary

## The Plan

### Wrangle the data
* Load data from xls file using pandas
* Prep data so it's easy to work with
* Prep data for modeling

### Explore the data
* Ask and answer all relevant questions that come to mind
* Discover relationships between features and the target variable (attrition)
    * Use visualizations to read the data
    * Run statistical tests when visualizations do not illuminate relationship

### Model
* Test a variety of features for modeling
* Develop 3 top models
* Run best model on test set 

### Deliver
Set up repository for readability, including a final notebook to report findings and this README for clarity. Compose project summary and writeup. Push all final commits.
